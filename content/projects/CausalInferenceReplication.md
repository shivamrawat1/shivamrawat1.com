Due to the limitations of propensity score matching (PSM), genetic matching was proposed for improving covariate balance for a 2021 study by Hussein Aljawad et al. The propensity score matching results of the original paper were replicated and then the paper was extended by using genetic matching. Based on the results of the paper and our extension, genetic matching is suggested as the better method for balancing covariates used in the study.
