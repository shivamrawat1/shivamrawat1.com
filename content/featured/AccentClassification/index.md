Semester-long exploration of audio classification and speaker diarization to differentiate accents and segment speakers. Implemented and evaluated ML models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, CNN, and RNN for accent classification.

Achieved 82% accuracy with Random Forest and 95% with CNN. Final phase focuses on speaker diarization using unsupervised learning, with manual annotation of speaker segments and exploration of generative models and transfer learning for "who spoke when" identification.
