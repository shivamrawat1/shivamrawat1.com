Developed a Python-based Task Scheduler to organize and execute tasks with dependencies, durations, and timing constraints. Implemented a priority queue system to manage task sequencing, ensuring adherence to dependencies and fixed start times. Key functionalities include task addition, priority calculation, dependency handling, and orderly execution. The scheduler tracks execution specifics, updates current time, and reports total duration upon completion. Tested with scenarios of independent and fixed-time tasks, with complexity analysis covering initialization, priority management, and scheduling efficiency based on task structure and dependencies.
